Pregunta 3:
I wish to retrieve data from my account table, but I do not know the ID of the relevant row.
However, I know the account name.
I can use the following code:

RetrieveRequest requestR = new RetrieveRequest()
{
    ColumnSet = new ColumnSet("name", "fax"),
    Target = new EntityReference("account", "name", "My Account 11")
};
var responseR = (RetrieveResponse)service.Execute(requestR);

However, it doesn't work, because I need to set something up in the table first.
I go to the Power Apps Portal, and go to Dataverse - Tables and select the account table.
What should I set up, to allow the above code to work?

A key
