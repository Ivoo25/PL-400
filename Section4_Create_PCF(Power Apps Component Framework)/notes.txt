PCF -> Creates components for MDA, Canvas and Power Pages
    -> Loaded at the same time as other components
    -> Can be used in any project
    -> Can use frameworks (React, fluent, etc)
To create a Component:
-> cmd -> pac pcf init --namespace PL400namespace --name PL400component --template field(pac: power apps component, pcf: power apps component framework, init: initialize, --namespace: namespace of the component, --name: name of the component, --template: type of component, namespace can be replaced with ns, name can be replaced with n, template can be replaced with t)

Manifest -> is metadata, it describes what the component does
If I make changes on the component I must change the version number, or changes wont be seen: 
    I go to the folder named after my name (PL400component in this case), ControlManidest.input.xml, and change the version number
